The controller (or controller node) is the machine you run Ansible on.
This might be your workstation or a container in a CI/CD pipeline.

== Use `ssh-agent` to remember SSH key passphrase

Ansible will open many SSH connections, and SSH will therefore ask for your SSH key passphrase.
You should use `ssh-agent` to keep it unlocked in memory:

```sh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"  # Start the SSH Agent in background
ssh-add  # Add the default identity file to the agent

# ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 # Provide another identity file

# eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" && ssh-add  # This shortcut also works.
```

== Add all hosts to `~/.ssh/known_hosts`

If you never connected to the hosts via SSH before, SSH will ask you to verify their fingerprint.

This snippet will just accept all SSH fingerprints:

```bash
for i in inventory*; do
  echo "== Processing $i..."
  supplemental/print-inventory-hosts.py $i | supplemental/authenticate-hosts.sh
  echo "== Processed $i."
done
```

WARNING: This is actually a security risk as SSH fingerprints are supposed to be checked manually -- even if nobody does that.
