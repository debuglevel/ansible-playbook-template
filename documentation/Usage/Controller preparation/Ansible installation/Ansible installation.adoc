To run this playbook, you will need Ansible.
Ansible requires a somewhat recent version of Python and Linux.
Windows is not supported -- just use WSL if you are working on a Windows machine.

See also https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html.

== Python requirements

For minimum Python versions required by Ansible, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#node-requirement-summary.
If the provided Python version is not at least Python 3.8, install it: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1197683/how-do-i-install-python-3-8-in-lubuntu-18-04.

== Install Ansible via `pip` in a virtual environment

As always if you use Python:
Just use a virtual environment -- you will do yourself a favor.

```sh
# Install the venv module if necessary.
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv

# Create the virtual environment if it does not yet exist.
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment.
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies.
pip3 install --upgrade pip  # Update pip, as old versions may cause errors
pip3 install --requirement requirements.txt
```

CAUTION: In WSL, it might be better to not create the virtual environment under `/mnt/c` as it will be quite slow.

== Install Ansible dependencies

```sh
ansible-galaxy install --role-file requirements.yaml
```
