To run this playbook, you will need Ansible.
Ansible requires a somewhat recent version of Python and Linux.
Windows is not supported -- just use WSL if you are working on a Windows machine.

See also https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html.

== Python requirements

For minimum Python versions required by Ansible, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#node-requirement-summary.
If the provided Python version is not at least Python 3.8, install it: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1197683/how-do-i-install-python-3-8-in-lubuntu-18-04.

== Install Ansible via `pip` in a virtual environment

As always if you use Python:
Just use a virtual environment -- you will do yourself a favor.

```sh
#sudo apt-get install python3.8 python3.8-dev python3.8-distutils python3.8-venv  # Install Python 3.8 if necessary (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04)
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -f python3-venv  # Install the venv module if necessary

# Create the virtual environment if it does not yet exist
#python -m venv venv
python3.8 -m venv venv  # ... if your default `python` is too old (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04)

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip  # Update pip, as old versions may cause errors
pip install -r requirements.yaml  # Install the following packages
pip install ansible  # NOTE: Works without `python3.8` as we're in a virtual environment now :)
pip install molecule[docker] pytest-testinfra yamllint ansible-lint  # If you want to run linting/tests
```

CAUTION: In WSL, it might be better to not create the virtual environment under `/mnt/c` as this is pretty slow.

== Install Ansible dependencies

```sh
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yaml
```
