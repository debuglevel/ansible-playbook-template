== Start virtual machine and run Ansible playbook

Create and boot a virtual machine via `vagrant up`.
This will use `Vagrantfile` which in turn runs Ansible to test (or at least execute) the playbook.

== Run provision (i.e. Ansible playbook) again

Run the provision scripts again via `vagrant provision` without recreating the virtual machine.

== Destroy virtual machine

Shut down and destroy the virtual machine via `vagrant destroy`.

== Destroy and start virtual machine

Destroy and start the virtual machine again via `vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up`.
