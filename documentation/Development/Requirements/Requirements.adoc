== Install Vagrant

We use Vagrant to start a fresh virtual machine image we can test our Ansible stuff against.

Install Vagrant according to https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.

== Install hypervisor

To actually use Vagrant, you need a "provider".

* On Linux, use VirtualBox.
 ** On Ubuntu, install it via: `sudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack`
* On Windows, use Hyper-V.
Be aware that you must execute `vagrant` in a shell with administrator privileges.
